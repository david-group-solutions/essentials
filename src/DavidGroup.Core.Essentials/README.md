## 🚀 What I'm Most Proud Of

One of the standout features of **DavidGroup.Core.Essentials** is its **high-performance** dynamic ordering query builder from string for LINQ and Entity Framework Core.
It delivers over **2× faster** execution and **cuts memory allocations in half** compared to System.Linq.Dynamic.Core, making it ideal for high-load APIs and advanced pagination scenarios.
